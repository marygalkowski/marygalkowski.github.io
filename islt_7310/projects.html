        Lovely Creatures is an experimental documentary short consisting of two contrasting parts. The first comments on the standards of beauty and femininity depicted in 20th-century etiquette videos which in many ways persist until today. Femininity in this view is singular and defined through the male gaze. The second half of this film gives voice to real, modern women and their beliefs and experiences, imagining what femininity can be through typically masculine styles of cinematography and editing often found in rap music videos. My strengths in this project were cinematography and production. My weaknesses were finding actors in a timely manner of a deadline. I learned more about color grade editing and experimental editing. What I would do differently is if I had more time to work on this project I would have extended it with more lengthened and detailed interviews of the subjects in the film.

    <p>The Stumblr is a short comedy involving a college student struggling to get home on his 21st birthday. He is controlled by several technicians in a control room who navigate his actions along the journey home. With several visual and audio effects, The Stumblr creates a two-part visual experience from the eyes of the viewer; both as the main character himself as well as the behind the scenes in the control room. My strengths in this film were editing and filming. I learned more about sound design and editing techniques that provided a more visually pleasing feel to the film. My weakness in this film was finding actors that were consistently available for their roles. One character was not able to make it to all of the shoots, which I found replaceable mid-filming to kill off that character and alter the script. One thing I would have done differently would be having better lighting during the night-time scenes.

</p><p>The third production project is a mental health disorder PSA miniseries of three commercial length advertisements with split-screen editing titled check on your happy friends. The right side of the screen shows how the world perceives how an individual acts and portrays themselves every day in a positive light, while the left side of the screen is how the individual feels inside and hides emotions. I strived to express a social issue that is affecting a large percentage of college students as well as all ages every single day.  Whether it be anxiety, smiling or walking depression, mental health is a significant topic that needs to be addressed more often, which is executed through this series. My strengths in this project were cinematography and writing. I created the script, layout and storyboard of this series, which succeeded. My weakness in this film was finding the appropriate text font within a deadline. One thing I would alter in this series is the text font used. </p>
