    Hi there and nice to meet you! My name is Mary Galkowski. I was born and raised in St. Louis, MO. I am majoring in Digital Storytelling and graduating this May of 2020. My areas of work and interest include film, photography, graphic design and social media. My favorite hobby is photography, which is what I enjoy doing in my free time. I would say I am fairly comfortable with technology. As a digital storyteller, I have gained experience working with Adobe Creative Suite, and took a course through Mizzou involving HTML and CSS. We practiced basic coding using Dreamweaver. My expectations for this course are that I get a better and broader understanding of it so that I am more familiar with how to properly code a website. I hope that I can eventually take this web development skill with me to benefit my future career in digital storytelling.
