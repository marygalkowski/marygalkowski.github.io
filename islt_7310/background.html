Mary had a recent internship at <a href= https://www.stlmag.com/topics/mary-galkowski class="stlmag">
        St. Louis Magazine</a> as an editorial intern during the summer of 2019. It began in May and concluded in July. She was instrumental to writing as a photojournalist as well as other content writing including:</p>
    <main>
    <ul>
        <li>news</li> 
       <li>weather</li>
       <li>wedding blogs</li>
       <li>music</li>
       <li>culture</li>
       <li>sports</li>
        <li>food</li>
    <li>health</li>
    </ul>
        </main>
  
    <p>While working at the magazine, she was able to take photographs at concerts, such as the Shawn Mendes concert at the Enterprise Center, and/or review concerts followed up by articles regarding the events. She also interviewed several musicians for pieces on individuals and their musically inspired stories.</p>
    
          <h3 style="font-style:oblique;">Print Publication</h3>
    <p>Her most accomplished piece while at this company was a story on Beth Bombara, a St. Louis native musician who tells the story of an accidental music journey. As an intern, her article succeeded in a two-page print of the September 2019 issue of the St. Louis Magazine.</p>
